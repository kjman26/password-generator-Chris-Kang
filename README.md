Purpose/Motivation:
    The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator to help others create unique passwords. The website allows the user to choose whether they want to include features such as special characters, numbers, upper or lower case and how many numbers (between 8-128) they wish their passwords to be.

Solution:
    This project allows the user to create a unique, randomized password with a few clicks to ensure safety and lower the chances of someone breaking into their account. 

What I learned:
    Javascript is very adaptable and can be used in many facets. It has many functions that allow the author to create interactive pages that are useful.

Features/Use:
    When clicking the "generate password" button, a series of prompts will appear with instructions about whether to include specific character types or not and the length of the password.
    After answering the prompts, the new password will be generated!
